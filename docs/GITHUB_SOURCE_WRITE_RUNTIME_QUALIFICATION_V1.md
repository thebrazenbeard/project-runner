# GitHub SOURCE_WRITE Runtime Qualification V1

Status: read-only runtime qualification + read-only OUTCOME_UNKNOWN reconciliation

WoWSQL is retired under current live project authority. This qualification does
not consult WoWSQL and does not assume or nominate a successor currentness
backend.

## Purpose

This layer qualifies the real GitHub route needed by the promoted
`SOURCE_WRITE` adapter without exercising source-write capability.

It also adds read-only reconciliation for a source-write attempt already
journaled as `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`.

## Runtime qualification

`github-source-write-runtime-qualify` requires the configured
`PROJECT_RUNNER_GITHUB_TOKEN` and performs only:

1. exact branch-ref read;
2. exact commit -> tree read;
3. GraphQL schema introspection;
4. branch-ref reread.

The probe requires the GraphQL schema to expose:

- mutation `updateRefs`;
- `UpdateRefsInput.repositoryId`;
- `UpdateRefsInput.refUpdates`;
- `RefUpdate.name`;
- `RefUpdate.beforeOid`;
- `RefUpdate.afterOid`;
- `RefUpdate.force`.

The two branch reads must match. A moving ref fails qualification rather than
mixing a tree/schema observation with a different current head.

The result always reports `write_exercised=false`.

The command never creates Git objects, calls `updateRefs`, writes a file, or
moves a ref.

## GitHub API contract

GitHub's current GraphQL documentation describes `updateRefs` as atomic and
states that `RefUpdate.beforeOid` requires the ref to point to the supplied OID
before updates are performed.

Runtime introspection verifies that the configured endpoint/token actually sees
the schema fields required by this source-controlled adapter.

Schema visibility is not write authorization. No mutation is executed by the
qualification command.

## OUTCOME_UNKNOWN reconciliation

A promoted GitHub source write can return `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` when ref publication
or post-publication readback cannot be proven.

The adapter now journals the candidate commit SHA and candidate blob SHA with
that result.

`github-source-write-reconcile` never replays the write. It reconstructs the
durable promotion and exact execution request, verifies their digest binding,
then performs:

```text
B0 branch head
-> target file read at exact B0 commit
-> B1 branch head
```

If B0 and B1 differ, reconciliation is `INDETERMINATE`.

On a stable snapshot:

- `EFFECT_CONFIRMED`: current head equals the candidate commit and the exact
  target blob/content equals the candidate blob/content;
- `NO_EFFECT_CONFIRMED`: current head still equals the pre-write exact head and
  the target blob still equals the pre-write blob, or remains absent for a
  planned new file;
- `INDETERMINATE`: live state matches neither exact state.

The outcome is persisted through Project Runner's existing durable
`execution_reconciliations` journal.

## Lifecycle behavior

For a recorded `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` only:

- `EFFECT_CONFIRMED` remains non-retryable and leaves the RUNNING work/fence
  in place for later verification/finalization;
- `INDETERMINATE` remains non-retryable and may later be refined by another
  read-only reconciliation;
- `NO_EFFECT_CONFIRMED` atomically releases the exact fence and moves the work
  to `FAILED_RETRYABLE`.

No other recorded backend classification is eligible for this reconciliation
path.

## Explicit non-effects

This layer does not:

- create or update a Git ref;
- create Git blobs, trees, or commits;
- mutate files;
- test write permission;
- merge or deploy;
- alter credentials or permissions;
- replay an unknown write;
- reintroduce WoWSQL.
