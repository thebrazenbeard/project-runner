# Project Runner Operator Execution V1

Status: source candidate stacked on the independently reviewed M6 canonical-baseline candidate. This document does not grant merge, deployment, or downstream mutation authority.

## Why this slice exists

Project Runner already had durable M6 work state, budgets, fenced leases, GitHub read/mutation primitives, execution journaling, currentness verification, and recovery classification. Its ordinary CLI still stopped at dispatch-report, which deliberately exercised an M4 mock backend. The system therefore had an execution engine without a general operator entry point.

Current orchestration systems converge on the same broad separation: durable workflow state is distinct from worker process lifetime, retries must not silently duplicate effects, and operator-triggered execution should be permission- and concurrency-bounded. Temporal emphasizes crash-resumable durable execution; GitHub Actions exposes explicit manual triggers, least-privilege token permissions, concurrency controls, and protected environments. Project Runner keeps its own evidence/authority model rather than importing either product's semantics.

## V1 operator contract

The command project-runner run-inspection executes exactly one already-derived READY + INSPECT frontier.

The command:

1. derives the frontier from the supplied before/after observations and dependency registry;
2. requires an exact target repository/ref/40-hex head;
3. binds the current project-registry SHA-256 into work identity;
4. creates a persistent SQLite lineage budget and root work record;
5. atomically admits execution, reserving budget and a fencing lease before backend work;
6. performs real GitHub READ_REF operations only under exact repository/ref grants;
7. journals the backend result before verification;
8. independently re-reads every exact input subject;
9. atomically finalizes terminal work + lease + verification evidence;
10. leaves interrupted attempts visible through project-runner operator-status.

The initial operator route is deliberately read-only. It does not create branches, write files, open/merge PRs, deploy, install, alter providers, or infer target authority from token capability.

## State and recovery honesty

The V1 state database is durable relative to the filesystem that stores it. SQLite is not magically cross-machine persistence. Running this command in an ephemeral CI runner without separately preserving the database does not create durable orchestration across runs.

operator-status exposes unresolved recovery classes already defined by M6. An ADMITTED attempt without a recorded result remains an ambiguous-effect state; Project Runner does not assume the backend did nothing and does not blindly re-execute it.

This slice intentionally does not auto-reconcile ambiguous effects or stale verification fences. Those require a separate bounded recovery design rather than pretending that retry is a synonym for safe.

## External/private registry behavior

The existing external registry digest and private collision-key requirements remain in force. run-inspection may operate against an explicitly selected private registry, but its success payload contains hashes/state classifications rather than repository or project identity. Detailed operator-status output is treated as a detailed report and remains disabled while an external project registry is selected.

These are design references, not runtime dependencies.

## Durable portfolio currentness and scheduler V1

`project-runner portfolio-cycle` removes the requirement to hand-author before/after observation snapshots for registered dependency refs. It:

1. loads one exact project-registry snapshot, one exact dependency-registry snapshot, and one exact worker-registry snapshot, each digest-bound;
2. validates that every dependency provider/consumer exists and that each selector repository belongs to its declared provider;
3. requires an exact dependency ref;
4. derives exact READ_REF grants from those validated selectors and performs only read-only GitHub ref reads;
5. writes a complete currentness snapshot only after every required read succeeds;
6. treats only the first cycle for a dependency-topology digest as an observation baseline; project/worker registry changes reuse compatible observations and re-evaluate unresolved exact-subject work;
7. compares later compatible cycles to their latest durable predecessor;
8. derives invalidations, frontiers, scheduling eligibility, and priority using the existing M6 logic;
9. commits the new snapshot and all scheduler decisions in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction with a predecessor CAS;
10. queues READY frontiers and persists blocked frontiers without executing either.

A failure during collection does not advance durable currentness. A concurrent cycle that advances the same exact scheduling configuration first causes the stale cycle to fail rather than overwrite or double-schedule from an obsolete predecessor. Unresolved unclaimed/retryable frontiers are recovered from durable history for the same dependency topology, filtered against the current exact subject, and re-evaluated under current project/worker authority.

Path-prefix dependencies are conservative in V1: currentness is collected at the exact ref head and the selector path-prefix is bound into the observation locus. A ref-head change can therefore over-invalidate a path-scoped dependency, but it cannot silently treat a changed Git commit as unchanged.

`project-runner portfolio-status` is count/digest oriented and does not dump portfolio subjects. The scheduler queue is durable evidence, not a standing execution grant.

## Fenced queue consumption and exact target resolution V1

Projects may now declare explicit `execution_targets` by work type. A target contains an exact repository and ref; its repository must already belong to the project. Target declaration is routing authority for the read-only operator bridge, not mutation authority.

Scheduler readiness now includes target availability. A schedulable/capable frontier without one declared target for its work type is persisted as `WAITING_AUTHORITY`, never `QUEUED`.

`project-runner consume-queue` consumes only READY supported read-only rows from the latest snapshot matching the current project-registry, dependency-registry, and worker-registry digests. The queue bridge:

1. claims one row with a monotonic fencing token;
2. refuses collision domains already held by another live queue claim, including claims from older snapshots;
3. binds the declared consumer repository/ref and resolves its exact current head through a grant-limited READ_REF;
4. persists that target head so a reclaimed attempt cannot silently retarget;
5. derives a deterministic operator lineage from the durable snapshot/frontier identity;
6. reconstructs the exact M6 inspection work identity before any possible re-execution;
7. if matching durable operator state is already terminal, reconciles the queue from it without backend re-execution;
8. if matching durable operator state exists but is nonterminal, records `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` and refuses blind re-execution;
9. otherwise invokes the existing durable read-only inspection operator and persists the queue outcome under the exact queue fence.

An unchanged currentness snapshot does not erase pending work. Pending semantic frontiers are carried forward, and queue consumption can recover compatible historical queue rows when their exact provider subject is still current. If a newer provider subject exists, the older subject is no longer claimable. Because this V1 execution ceiling is read-only, stale OUTCOME_UNKNOWN/ROUTED reads remain auditable but do not reserve the collision domain against newer exact-subject read-only work.

`project-runner queue-status` exposes aggregate claim states. External/private queue failures collapse to generic errors rather than echoing private registry or topology details.

The committed public-safe registry intentionally contains only the explicit execution targets already justified by public Project Runner state. Missing targets in other projects are not guessed.

## Queue reconciliation and read-only worker routing V1

Worker routing is explicit and fail-closed. A project execution target may bind a `worker_id` plus an invocation route. A routed worker must exist in the exact worker-registry snapshot, be `EXECUTABLE`, have that exact route marked `VERIFIED`, and carry a route contract that classifies the route as `READ_ONLY`. Route contracts also declare replay policy (`SAFE`, `RECONCILE_REQUIRED`, or `NEVER`).

Worker-registry bytes are part of scheduler currentness. Route-state or route-contract changes therefore create a new scheduling configuration, but they preserve compatible observation continuity and re-evaluate unresolved exact-subject work under the new worker authority rather than discarding it.

For qualified non-INSPECT work such as RETEST/REREVIEW/REQUALIFY, queue consumption resolves and freezes the exact consumer target head, then atomically changes the queue item to `ROUTED` while inserting one digest-bound worker-route outbox envelope. The envelope binds the queue fence, worker-registry digest, worker identity, invocation route, replay policy, exact target, and exact frontier payload. The public registry currently has no executable verified worker routes, so no existing Custom GPT registration is silently activated by this feature.

`project-runner worker-route-status` exposes aggregate route-envelope state. Qualified routes may be delivered through the generic pull adapter: `claim-worker-route` atomically claims one matching envelope under a monotonic delivery fence and writes the exact packet to a caller-selected file without echoing the packet to stdout. `record-worker-receipt` accepts a receipt only from the exact worker/route/holder/fence and records one immutable receipt class plus SHA-256 binding.

`OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` and `ROUTED` both continue to reserve their collision domain until explicit reconciliation. Delivery replay follows the route contract: SAFE may reclaim an expired delivery automatically; RECONCILE_REQUIRED freezes an expired claim as ambiguous until explicit reconciliation; NEVER cannot be released for replay. Routed reconciliation requires the exact snapshot, frontier fingerprint, queue fence, SHA-256 evidence binding, and reconciler identity. A routed receipt must be compatible with the requested resolution. `CONFIRM_COMPLETE` additionally performs independent live READ_REF currentness checks of both the provider ref and bound consumer target ref; a worker `SUCCEEDED` receipt alone is never completion. Queue and routed outbox state reconcile in one transaction. An explicit retry release advances attempt generation and derives a new deterministic lineage.

Reconciliation evidence is an explicit operator-supplied binding; Project Runner does not pretend the digest independently proves the underlying external fact.

## Current ceiling and next frontier

The runtime remains read-only. The generic delivery adapter now provides fenced pull/receipt mechanics, but it does not manufacture or activate an external route. The twelve committed worker records remain REGISTERED with UNVERIFIED routes, so none is presently deliverable through this mechanism.

The remaining worker frontier is external qualification of a concrete route and its endpoint-specific adapter/receipt semantics. Mutation execution remains a separate authority-gated frontier with expected-state checks and independent postcondition verification.
